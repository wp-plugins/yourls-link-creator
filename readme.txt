== Frequently Asked Questions ==


= What's this all about? =

This plugin creates a shortlink (stored in the post meta table) for each post that can be used in sharing buttons, etc.

= What is YOURLS? =

YOURLS is a self-hosted PHP based application that allows you to make your own custom shortlinks, similar to bit.ly and j.mp. [Learn more about it here](http://yourls.org/ "YOURLS download")

= How do I use the template tag? =

Place the following code in your theme file (usually single.php) `do_action('yourls_display');`

= The delete function doesn't remove the short URL from my YOURLS installation =

This is a limitation with the YOURLS API, as there is not a method yet to delete a link. The delete function has been added to the plugin to allow users to get the updated URL that they may have changed in the YOURLS admin panel
